# odin-recipes
This current project is a practice and presentation of the HTML knowledge I have acquired throughout this course. 
I am going to create a basic, brutalist-style cooking recipe website.
I will have demonstrated the usage of basic HTMl syntax such as text, links, images and basic styling of said text (bold and italic).
